# Environment variables

## Introduction

An environment variable is a variable whose value is set from outside the program, typically through functionality built into the operating system or microservice. An environment variable is made up of a key/value pair.

## Backend variables

For backend we use the following `environment variables`

```env
API_VERSION=v1
