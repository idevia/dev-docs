# Guide for writing JavaScript code

## Naming

Naming plays a very important role in coding. We have decided to use `cammelCasing` for our variable and function names.

Do's

?> **myAwesomeVariable**, **iLikeJs**, **variableName**

Don't's

!> **my_awesome_variable**, **IlikeJS**, **variablename**

## Nesting

**One of the very important questions is should braces (`{` and `}`) have their own line or not?** Perfect answer does not exist for this question. It's all about consistency. So we have decided to not give them a separate line. You will be coding like

```javascript
// if statements
if (condition) {
  // Code ...
} else {
  // Code ...
}

// For loops
for (...) {
  // Code
}

// Functions
myFunction = () => {
  // Your code here
}
```

# Indentation

Must use **2 space** indentaion. Not a space more not a space less.

```javascript
myFunction () => {
..// Your code
}
```
